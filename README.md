# R You Ready?

This repository contains the two files used in the demonstration of R Markdown for the July 25th **R You Ready** Sage Webinar. To try opening and using this file, follow these steps:

1) Download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (the CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org).
2) Download and install the free Desktop version of RStudio from the RStudio website (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3) Download two files from this repository, `R-you-ready-demo.Rmd` and `dist_ssp_amfar_ch9.csv`, and save them together in the **same folder**. You can do this by using the green `download` button in the top right corner of the file window or by clicking on each file separately and downloading.
4) Open RStudio.
5) Use the File menu in RStudio to open the `R-you-ready-demo.Rmd` file you saved from wherever you saved it. 
6) As the file opens it may prompt you to install tidyverse, do this! If it does not prompt you to install tidyverse, go to the Tools menu, choose `Install Packages...`, type **tidyverse** in the dialog box that opens, and click `Install` to install it. You'll see a bunch of code while R installs the package.
7) Click "Knit" at the top of the window that shows all the R code, it has a tiny blue ball of yarn next to it.

A new windown should open containing the slides!

Congratulations, you just knit your first R Markdown slides document. Play around with the file to see what you can figure out. :-)

Enjoy!
